## Warning: Digital-VM.com is a scam!

I lost my money to Digital-VM.com—don’t make the same mistake! This is a one-man operation with no real customer support, tech team, or sales. They used to go by Virpus.com, scammed many people, then changed their name to Digital-VM.com to keep cheating others.

This is a shady, dishonest company. Stay away and don’t get tricked like I did!

## Update on June 13, 2025:
I purchased two VPS servers from this company. One of them was shut down by them under a flimsy excuse. Thinking the service had expired, I renewed it for six months and messaged them to restore the service—but got no response. So, I filed a refund request through PayPal. At that point, this scam company, Digital-VM, threatened me, saying they would not only refuse the refund but also shut down my other server if I didn’t withdraw the PayPal claim. Fortunately, thanks to my efforts, PayPal stood for justice and refunded my money.

## Update on June 14, 2025:
My other server, which was running normally, has now been shut down by Digital-VM.com…


## 警惕: Digital-VM.com 是个诈骗公司!
我刚被Digital-VM.com骗了钱，提醒每个人不要上当了！ 这是一个人的（one-man）公司，没有客服、技术、销售，原来叫virpus.com，欺骗了很多人后，又改个名字叫Digital-VM.com继续在网络上诈骗。这是一家垃圾公司，提醒每个人不要像我一样上当！

我从这家买了两个VPS服务器，其中一台被他们随便找个理由关闭了，我以为是服务到期，于是续费了6个月，然后发信息让开启服务，结果无人理睬。于是我找paypal申请退款，此时这家诈骗公司digital-vm发信息威胁我，说不仅不会退款，而且如果我不撤回paypal申请，他们就关闭我的另一个服务器。不过在我的努力下，正义的paypal把钱退给了我。 但是垃圾+骗子公司digital-vm.com删除了我的数据。

我的另一个正常运行的服务器被digital-vm.com关闭了……
